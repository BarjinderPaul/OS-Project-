This question contains the concept of Multilevel Scheduling. In this question, we are implementing at level 1: Fixed priority preemptive scheduling and at level 2: Round Robin scheduling. At level 1 i.e., Fixed priority preemptive scheduling, in it if P1 process is to be scheduled to run and then another process P2 with a higher priority comes, it will preempt the currently running P1 process and the P1 process will go the queue at level 2. Similarly all the processes which will be preempted will go the queue at level 2. At level 2, we will follow Round Robin scheduling. In this question, we also have a constraint that the queue at level 2 will only execute after the completion of execution of queue at level 1 i.e., the priority of queue at level 2 has lower priority than the queue at level 1.
