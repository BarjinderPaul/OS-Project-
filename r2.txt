Step 1. When the program starts to execute, the processes start to execute and these all enter queue 1.
Step 2 . Processes will execute for 4 unit of time whenever they will be in queue 1
Step 3. If a certain process does not executes completely in it’s 4 unit of time, then It’s priority will be reduced and it will shifted to the queue at level 2.
Step 4. Now, we will process the processes in the queue 2 at the level 2 via round robin scheduling with a quantum 0f 8 units of time.
Step 5. The process which will have lower priority will be interrupted by the process which will be having the higher priority.
